This library encapsulates the core data and rules (plus a few auxiliary bits
of data and rules) for D&D, 3rd edition.

BUILDING

This library was written well before I knew anything about autoconf and
friends. Thus, the makefile should be considered to be only a guideline, and
you're expected to actually MUCK WITH IT. Yes, I know. How deliciously
primitive.
